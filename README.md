# Investment-Calculator
This program calculates the growth of an investment based on user input. 

In this program I made good use of classes. I initialized my functions and variables for my class in one file, defined my functions in another file, and then used main() to call the classes and functions from my other files. I can absolutely transfer the skills I utilized in this project to any other project. OOP is important in most coding languages.
