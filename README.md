# Investment-Calculator
This program calculates the growth of an investment based on user input. 

In this program I made good use of classes. I initialized my functions and variables for my class in a header file, defined my functions in the InvestmentCalculator.cpp file, and then used the main.cpp file to call the classes and functions from the other files I created. I can absolutely transfer the skills I utilized in this project to almost any other coding project. OOP is important in most coding languages and gaining a good grasp on it in this project is an important step in my programming journey.
