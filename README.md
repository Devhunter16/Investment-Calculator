# Investment-Calculator
This program calculates the growth of an investment based on user input. 

In this program I made good use of classes. I initialized my functions and variables for my class in a header file, defined my functions in the InvestmentCalculator.cpp file, and then used the main.cpp file to call the classes and functions from the other files I created. I can absolutely transfer the skills I utilized in this project to almost any other coding project. OOP is important in most coding languages and gaining a good grasp on it in this project is an important step in my programming journey.

Something that I would have liked to do and could possibly do with more time was to make the display erase and then re-display rather than just having the program output a new display under the last every time the user wants to input different information. It would make the final product look cleaner.

The most challenging parts of the code to write were the functions which did the actual calculations for the project. 

I made my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable by commenting so that the uses of each class and function are explained. I also named my variables and functions so that anyone reading the code could get a good grasp of what those functions and variables did without even having to read the comments. Creating member functions within my class made my code adaptable due to being able to edit and work within those individual functions rather than getting lost editing the program as a whole.
